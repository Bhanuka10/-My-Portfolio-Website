    prompt:"I led the project team by assigning tasks, coordinating sprints, facilitating daily standups, and resolving technical blockers to ensure all milestones and deadlines were successfully met. I designed and implemented the Laravel-based backend architecture, including RESTful APIs, authentication, and role-based access control, while defining the business logic for room allocation, fee processing, and staff management. I modeled and optimized the database schema for students, rooms, payments, and staff data, ensuring scalability and performance. Additionally, I developed the automated room allocation engine that efficiently handles capacity, roommate preferences, and conflict resolution, reducing the need for manual intervention. I integrated payment and billing modules with online payment hooks, transaction tracking, and automated reminders for overdue fees. To support data-driven decisions, I also created admin dashboards and automated reports for occupancy, fee collection, and payroll summaries."+

"On the design and user experience side, I created the complete application interface in Figma, ensuring a visually consistent and intuitive experience for both administrators and students. I implemented a self-service student portal where residents can view personal profiles, payment history, and room details, as well as submit repair or leave requests. Furthermore, I integrated in-app and email/SMS notification systems for reminders and announcements, improving communication between management and residents. I also built staff management and payroll modules to handle HR-related operations efficiently. To ensure system security, I implemented input validation, CSRF protection, secure password storage, and strict role-based permissions. Throughout development, I maintained quality through unit and integration testing, end-to-end validation, and bug fixes. Finally, I containerized the application, set up automated deployments, and prepared developer and user documentation while conducting training sessions for hostel staff to ensure a smooth handover and adoption of the system.",
